Bandits have killed at least nine people during a fresh attack on Kaduna-Kachia Road, Kaduna State.  The gunmen also abducted an unspecified number of people, which occurred about 10.30pm on Monday, near Kasuwan Magani in Kajuru Local Government Area in the southern part of the state. Sources said the bandits waylaid the travellers going to Kaduna from the Kachia end of the highway.  They opened fire on the travellers, killed nine people on the spot and injured many others.  A source, however, said it was difficult to determine the actual figure of those kidnapped because the vehicles were many.  According to the source, it    was also possible that some people might have escaped.  The source added there were several commercial and private vehicles which were coming from the Kachia axis, heading towards the Kaduna axis. Meanwhile, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Muhammad Jalige, was yet to react to the incident.   At least 26 persons were said to have been abducted by gunmen in two separate incidents in Kaduna State Friday evening.   The first incident took place along the Kaduna -Kachia road while the second one occurred in Kugo village in Chikun Local Government Area of the state.   This… January 31, 2021 In "News" It has been a harrowing experience for the government and people of Kaduna State since 2015.
