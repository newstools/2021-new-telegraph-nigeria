In a late-night tweet, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control said 1,964 new cases and seven deaths had been recorded across the country within 24 hours.
This brings the total number of recorded cases to 116,655, with 93,646 discharged cases and a total death toll of 1,485.
Lagos, the epicentre of the pandemic in Nigeria, reported 824 new cases while the FCT posted 246 infections.

According to NGF Chairman and Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, Nigeria is expected to take delivery of a tranche of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of February.
Global Update
Meanwhile, the novel coronavirus has killed at least 2,075,698 people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP at 1100 GMT on Thursday.
At least 96,825,840 cases have been registered.
These figures are based on daily tolls provided by health authorities in each country and excludes later re-evaluations by statistical organisations, as has happened in Russia, Spain and Britain.
On Wednesday, 17,502 new deaths and 674,124 new cases were recorded worldwide.
Based on latest reports, the countries with the most new deaths were the United States with 4,261 new deaths, followed by the United Kingdom with 1,820 and Mexico with 1,539.
The United States remains the worst-affected country with 406,162 deaths from 24,438,935 cases.

Since the start of the pandemic, the number of tests conducted has greatly increased while testing and reporting techniques have improved, leading to a rise in reported cases.
However the number of diagnosed cases is only a part of the real total number of infections as a significant number of less serious or asymptomatic cases always remain undetected.
