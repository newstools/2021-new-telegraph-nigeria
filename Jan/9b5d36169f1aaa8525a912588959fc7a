 Enoch Adegoke, on Saturday, at the Athletics Federation of Nigeria All Comers meet ran 10.16seconds in the men’s 100m.

The performance with a legal wind of +0.8  is also the world-leading time for the 2021 season. Godson Brume finished second with 10.27seconds, while Alaba Akintola was third with 10.40seconds.

In the women’s final Joy Udo-Gabriel topped the field with 11.72s, Praise Idamadudu was second.
