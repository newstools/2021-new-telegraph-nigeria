We are, however, fortunate to be going into the New Year, with an already passed budget, which will help to expedite our recovery process. “A significant portion of the budget has been committed to human capital development, youth engagement, social intervention initiatives, and the completion of ongoing projects that are critical to achieving the objectives of our T.H.E.M.E.S agenda. The Honourable Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget will present to the general public the full details and breakdown of the budget in due course.”  Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State Thursday hit the ground running with the signing of the 2021 Appropriation Bill recently passed by the Lagos State House of Assembly into law, saying the task of rebuilding Lagos has begun.
