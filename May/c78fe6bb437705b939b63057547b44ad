 Some hoodlums wielding matchets and sticks have disrupted the ongoing Nigeria Leaders Congress (NLC) protest in Kaduna.
The hoodlums stormed the protest scene along Nepa Roundabouts to chase away the NLC protesters who gathered to protest the Kaduna state government’s decision to sack workers.
Policemen, however, dispersed the hoodlums with tear gas.
It was learnt that security agents are still at the protest scene to maintain law and order.
