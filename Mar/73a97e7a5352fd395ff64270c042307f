Governance: Aisha, Okonjo-Iweala, Tinubu, Mohammed, others brave the odds  As the world marks this year’s International Women’s Day, Felix NWANERI, WALE ELEGBEDE and ANAYO EZUGWU report on Nigerian women, who have braved the odds to break the glass ceiling in politics and governance in the present dispensation   It is echoes of affirmative action in Nigeria as the world marks this year’s International Women’s Day (IWD), today.  Observed every March 8, the day is used to celebrate the cultural, political, economic and social achievements of women. It also marks a call to action to achieve gender parity.  The day also helps people across the globe to reflect on the extraordinary roles played by women in almost every walk of life and celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women.  <img data-attachment-id="100937" data-permalink="https://www.newtelegraphng.com/the-women-are-coming/women-in-politics-2/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/women-in-politics-2.png?fit=467%2C245&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="467,245" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="women in politics 2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/women-in-politics-2.png?fit=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/women-in-politics-2.png?fit=467%2C245&amp;ssl=1" class="size-medium wp-image-100937 alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/women-in-politics-2.png?resize=300%2C157&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="157" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/women-in-politics-2.png?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/women-in-politics-2.png?resize=464%2C245&amp;ssl=1 464w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/women-in-politics-2.png?w=467&amp;ssl=1 467w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" />The theme of this year’s celebration is: “Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world.” No doubt, most countries across the world have made great advancements; gender equality remains an unfulfilled dream. According to the United Nations (UN), legal restrictions have kept 2.7 billion women from accessing the same choice of jobs as men.  As of 2019, less than 25 per cent of parliamentarians were women and one in three women experience genderbased violence. This year’s women’s day is totally different keeping in view the COVID-19 pandemic. This, perhaps, explains the theme of this year’s celebration, which is: “Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world.” The belief is that as nations initiate recovery plans to get out of the pandemic, it is time to end the marginalisation and exclusion of women and girls.  Those who hold this view insist that women must be given opportunities and responsibilities to play a proactive role in shaping important decisions as countries prepare recovery responses from the coronavirus pandemic. They further advanced that for such dream to become a reality, countries across the world, especially developing ones like Nigeria, must, first, break cultural, historic and socio-economic barriers that prevent the progress of women.  No doubt, some Nigerian women have made appreciable marks in the country’s polity, but it is still clamour for 35 per cent participation of women in governance across all tiers of government. The belief is that improving women participation in government is necessary because it will help to strengthen the nation’s democracy. ItwouldberecalledthattheFederalGovernment, had in Year 2000 adopted a policy called the National Policy of Women to ensure that women have equal opportunity as men to participate in government. The policy also seeks to address the imbalance of women representation in the country and attempts to strike a balance.  However, like most government’s policies, its implementation has only been on paper as there has been little improvement in women participation in governance since 1999, when Nigeria returned to civil rule.  This explains why some stakeholders, particularly women right activists, have persistently insisted that government at all levels must address exclusion of women from governance.  To these stakeholders, the decline in the number of women in elective positions in the present political dispensation explains why the major political parties should see the necessity for the advancement of women representation in public positions. They also argued that government has a responsibility to define and increase the opportunity for women’s entry and growth into male-dominated careers.  No doubt, Nigerian women are still on the backbench in politics and governance at a time it is a global trend for women to be actively engaged, but some of them have braved the odds to break the glass ceiling.  Aisha Buhari  The President’s wife is a woman of immense clout, sophistication and one who understands political power and its usage.  Since she stepped into Nigeria’s seat of power, Aso Rock, with her husband in 2015, she has proved that she does not belong to the league of Nigerian leaders whose spouses are only seen but not heard. She has resisted very attempt to make her remain in the shadow of her husband, President Muhammadu Buhari, and she even ensured that her husband had a rethink with his decision not to have a functional Office of the First Lady. On several occasions, she had publicly called to question the decisions of some of her husband’s allies and aides.  She has also remained vocal and critical about national issues, especially the running of her husband’s administration. Born of February 17, 1971, the First Lady is a cosmetologist, beauty therapist, author, and mother of five. Love or loath her, she is a different type of first lady and she will continue to shape events and issues in the country.

She is a passionate woman, who places a premium on substance and value. The nation’s number two woman is quite influential around the corridors of power despite her delicate poise. She is the Executive Director of the Women’s Helping Hand Initiative, a refuge facility in Epe, Lagos, established in 2014, and a co-founder of the Orderly Society Trust.
