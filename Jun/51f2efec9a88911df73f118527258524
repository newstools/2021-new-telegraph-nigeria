 Burna Boy, Nigerian singer, has beaten Wizkid, his colleague, to clinch the ‘Best International Act’ category at the 2021 edition of the BET Awards.
The awards, which honour black excellence in entertainment and sports, took place at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles on Sunday.
Tems also lost the ‘Best International New Act’ gong to Bree Runway, the English singer and songwriter.
Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion were among the biggest winners on the night, with the former announcing her pregnancy during a live performance.
Wizkid and Burna Boy have had an impressive run at the annual event, with the duo scooping an award each at last year’s edition.
The development further stretches the heroics of the ‘African Giant’ crooner, who snagged his first-ever Grammy award earlier this year, in the global music landscape.
Burna Boy is also winning the category for the third time in a row. The ‘African Giant’ crooner won the Best International Act category at the 2019 and 2020 BET Awards.
